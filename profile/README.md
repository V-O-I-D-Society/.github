### 🚀 About Us

VOID Society is KIET's specialized club focused on the intersection of low-level systems development and cybersecurity. We explore the depths of computer architecture, operating systems, and network protocols to understand security from first principles. Our community brings together students passionate about binary exploitation, reverse engineering, systems programming, and advanced threat detection. Through hands-on workshops, CTF competitions, and deep-dive projects, we build expertise in both creating and securing complex systems.
